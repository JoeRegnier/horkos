## Summary
Horkos-ui displays issues generated by the horkos-extractor that have been identified as possible data anomolies. The issues are divided into categories based on the query used to identify them. Issues can be filtered using the Open, Ignored, and Verified buttons in the header. They can also be sorted by either Score (descending) or Date. There are two views for the issues, a carousel view for a quick glance and a list view to see more issues at once. Additional query details and charts are also provided to provide more context to the user.

Users are also able to create, delete, or modify existing queries using the admin page at /horkos/admin

Main page: /horkos/
